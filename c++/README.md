----------------

# Overview

The [Makefile](./Makefile) defines the build process for the project

`make` will make the entire project
`make clean` cleans the project

## Known Improvements



# Testing

## Unit tests



## Integration Tests



## Timing

I tested the times to write 1 meg, 10 meg, 100 meg and 1 gig files:
* 1 Mb = 
* 10 Mb = 
* 100 Mb = 
* 1 Gig = 

This was on a 4th Gen Intel laptop with a SATA SSD, I haven't tested the speeds on more modern CPU or hard drive technology.
